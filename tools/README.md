# Program Artifact Pipeline

`programs/` specs are source; compiled artifacts are build outputs and are
never committed. The `program-artifacts` workflow compiles every spec through
axiom-compose + axiom-rules-engine (pinned refs in the workflow env):

- **On PRs** it is a gate: any spec outside `tools/known-broken-specs.txt`
  that fails to compile fails the check, so spec/corpus drift (renamed module
  paths, coverage-gate violations) is caught at PR time.
- **On main** it publishes `dist/` — provenance-stamped `*.compiled.json`,
  composed `*.rulespec.yaml`, and `manifest.json` — as a GitHub release
  tagged `program-artifacts-<shortsha>`.

Every artifact's `metadata.provenance` records the corpus SHA, spec path +
sha256, composer version, and engine version; the manifest carries the same
plus artifact sha256s. Given a corpus commit and the pinned toolchain, the
build is byte-reproducible.

Consumers (axiom-api) pin a release tag and per-file sha256s instead of
vendoring artifacts. To admit a program: land its spec here, wait for the
release, then bump the consumer's pin.

The workflow also signs GitHub build-provenance attestations for
`manifest.json` and every `*.compiled.json`. Consumers can verify a
downloaded artifact was built by this workflow from this repo:

```bash
gh attestation verify manifest.json --repo TheAxiomFoundation/rulespec-us
```

Run locally:

```bash

  python tools/build_program_artifacts.py           # writes dist/
```

# Engine root load

The `engine-root-load` workflow asks the question issue #1354 showed nothing
else asked: does `axiom-rules-engine`, at `axiom_rules_engine_ref` in
`.axiom/workflow-toolchain.toml`, load this checkout as a corpus root?
Repository Checks skips every module with an active known-validation-gaps
waiver, so it stayed green while hundreds of modules declared fields that
engine had removed.

`tools/engine_root_load.py` writes a small Rust harness into the pinned engine
checkout as a Cargo example, builds it with `--locked`, admits the checkout
once as a `CanonicalRuleSpecRoots` root, and compiles every atomic module
under `<jurisdiction>/{legislation,policies,regulations,statutes}/` through
`CompiledProgramArtifact::from_rulespec_file`, the entry point behind
`axiom-rules-engine compile`. A stored `module.kind: composition` module, which
the engine refuses on that surface, is also compiled from a copy outside the
checkout through `from_composed_rulespec_file`.

Failures must equal `tools/known-engine-load-failures.txt`
(`<surface>\t<class>\t<module>`) exactly:

- a module that fails and is not listed fails the check;
- a listed module that no longer fails that way fails the check, so a fix
  deletes its line in the same change;
- when the protected base already has a baseline and the engine pin is
  unchanged, a pull request may only shrink the failing `(surface, module)`
  set. A listed module may change class: the engine reports only a module's
  first error, so fixing one can expose another;
- when the protected base has no baseline, the check establishes the first
  baseline without enforcing that shrinking rule. Moving
  `axiom_rules_engine_ref` also permits baseline growth: a newer engine may
  reject more, and the pin bump is where those failures are listed and reviewed.

Run locally from a checkout whose directory is named exactly `rulespec-us`:

```bash
python tools/engine_root_load.py run --engine-src ../axiom-rules-engine \
  --output /tmp/engine-root-load.jsonl
python tools/engine_root_load.py check --results /tmp/engine-root-load.jsonl \
  --base-ref origin/main
python tools/engine_root_load.py baseline --results /tmp/engine-root-load.jsonl \
  > tools/known-engine-load-failures.txt   # after deliberately fixing modules
```

# Source-conflict register

`known-source-conflicts.yaml` records the places where a jurisdiction's
sources disagree, the readings each side supports, and the reading adopted.
Disagreements include a statute against a regulation, a regulation against an
agency manual, and one manual section against another. Every rulespec
repository keeps its own register at its root. The Axiom-wide view is
generated from them with `tools/source_conflicts.py aggregate`; nothing keeps
a second copy.

## Entry shape

An entry's interpretation core is a RuleSpec `module.interpretations` v1
entry: `question`, `texts`, `reading`, `alternatives`, `basis`, `status`,
`ruling` and `confirmation`, with the same field names and status rules.
`open` forbids `ruling` and `confirmation`; `ruled` requires `ruling`;
`confirmed` and `contradicted` require both, and `contradicted` is always a
finding. So when the provision is encoded, the entry moves into the module
unchanged and the module adds `affects`. The register then names that module
under `adopted_by`. The global id of an entry is `<jurisdiction>:<id>`, for
example `us:oasdi-family-maximum-saving-clause`; code outside RuleSpec cites
that id.

Register-only fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `jurisdiction`, `program` | A jurisdiction directory of this repository, and a kebab-case program slug. |
| `pending_texts` | Provisions the pinned corpus release lacks. Each gives `citation`, `url`, an `excerpt`, and a `snapshot`: repo, commit, path and sha256 of a captured copy. An entry that a module adopts cannot have any; ingest them first. |
| `outcome` | `computed` or `refused`: whether the adopted reading computes the contested cases or refuses them. For a refusal, `reading` says what is refused and the substantive readings go in `alternatives`. |
| `adopted_by` | RuleSpec modules in this repository that carry the entry, as `module` (path) and `interpretation` (id) pairs. |
| `implementations` | Code outside RuleSpec that adopts a reading: `repo`, `commit`, `path`, `follows` (`reading` or `alternatives[N]`, meaning what the code does today) and `cites_entry`, which says whether the file contains the global id. |
| `tests` | Tests that pin readings: `path`, `name` (a function, `Class::function` or `[param]`, or a companion-test case name) and `pins`, a list of `reading` or `alternatives[N]`. Add `repo` and `commit` for a test in another repository. |
| `money_case` | An invented case showing the size of the difference: `description`, `amount` (a decimal string), `currency` and `period` (once, week, month or year). |

The register is public. It carries no people's names, decision-queue ids,
session ids, local paths or email addresses. `ruling.by` and `confirmation.by`
name organisations, and `ruling.record` is a public PR, issue or comment.

## Checks

`tools/source_conflicts.py check` runs offline. `tests/test_source_conflicts.py`
runs it inside the required Repository Checks pytest leg, and it fails on any
of these:

- a malformed entry, an unknown key or a broken status rule;
- a hygiene hit;
- an adopting module that is missing, or that does not carry the entry's
  interpretation core unchanged, or whose `affects` name no rule in the module;
- an in-repo test that does not exist;
- a followed reading that no test pins, or a module adopter whose `reading`
  no test pins;
- a ruled, confirmed or contradicted module interpretation whose texts cite
  two or more provisions but which no entry adopts. Provisions in tension are
  a source disagreement, so they belong in the register. An unregistered `open`
  one is only a warning, because signed encoder re-encodes carry the module and
  its manifest alone and may emit open interpretations. The `source-conflicts`
  workflow lists those warnings in a tracking issue. Its entry is written when
  a ruling or a publisher's reply arrives.

`tools/source_conflicts.py verify` needs the network and runs in the
`source-conflicts` workflow on pull requests touching the register, on pushes
to main, daily and on dispatch. It checks:

- every `texts` excerpt is verbatim at its citation in the pinned corpus release
  from `.axiom/toolchain.toml`;
- every `pending_texts` excerpt is verbatim in its snapshot, whose sha256 must
  match;
- external implementations and tests exist at their pinned commits;
- each `cites_entry` claim matches its file.

Both excerpt checks use axiom-encode's own resolver and proof-atom matcher at
`axiom_encode_ref`. The verify report lists implementations that do not cite
their entry yet and implementations that follow an alternative rather than
the adopted reading. The workflow is not a required check; a red scheduled or
main run opens an alarm issue. `tests/test_source_conflicts_properties.py`
(Hypothesis) states the tool's invariants, including a differential test
against axiom-encode's `_validate_module_interpretations` that runs once the
pinned encoder has module interpretations.
